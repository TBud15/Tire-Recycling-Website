# Project Overview

This project is built using modern web technologies to create a fast, optimized, and scalable web application.

## Key Features

- **Internationalization (i18n)**: The site supports multiple languages using the next-int library, making it accessible to a global audience. Right now, itâ€™s available in two languages
  
- **TypeScript**: The entire codebase is written in TypeScript, which helps with maintainability and reduces runtime errors thanks to strong typing.

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: The project is built with Next.js, which enables server-side rendering to improve page load speed and SEO. This makes the site more performant and helps follow best SEO practices.

- **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first framework that makes it easy to build a responsive and visually consistent UI across different devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **next-int**: Library for handling internationalization in Next.js apps.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework that speeds up UI development.
